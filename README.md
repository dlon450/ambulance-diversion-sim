# Data-Adaptive Ambulance Diversion via ED Simulation
We integrate AI-digital-twins to optimize ambulance diversion policies in emergency departments during healthcare crises, demonstrating how data-adaptive decision-making can improve mortality outcomes by dynamically adjusting diversion thresholds based on predicted patient surges, while addressing the computational challenges of real-time optimization through metamodeling.

## Getting Started
The `simulation.ipynb` notebook contains a step-by-step guide on how to run the simulation and generate the results. Models for forecasting arrival rates and predicting thresholds are too big to store in Git: please open an issue in this repository with your contact information (i.e., email address) and I will provide them.
